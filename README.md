## A lightweight Java framework salute the Unix Philosophy of small and simple.

"Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together" is the Unix Philosophy.

We refer [Microservice Architecture](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) to think how to make Java application more flexible and concise.

After the trend of DI and AOP, we heard a lot of talks about "Resource Oriented", "Event Driven".
So we try to create a small library or framework for testing some thoughts on Java development nowdays. Those implements are deeply influenced by [Lavarel](http://laravel.com/), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).
